A web application that serves as my website and a playground to try stuff and inovate.

Architecture:

- Node server running Express
- React 
- Redux
- Styled Components
- Docker
- Heroku (maybe later on AWS with Terraform & Ansile orchestrated by Jenkins)
- GraphQL

TODOS: 

- check the ESLint altervative recommended by Andy or try JSLint
- setup webpack-dev-server
