A web application that serves as my website and a playground to try stuff and inovate.

Architecture:

- Node server running Express
- React 
- Redux
- Styled Components
- Docker
- Heroku (maybe later on AWS with Terraform & Ansile orchestrated by Jenkins)
- GraphQL

HMR: https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/
REACT-HOT-LOADER: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader
Options:
- remove nodemon from dev and use babel-node src/server/server.js

Start the app correctly on Heroku:

TODOS: 

- check the ESLint altervative recommended by Andy or try JSLint
- setup webpack-dev-server
- add emoji library
