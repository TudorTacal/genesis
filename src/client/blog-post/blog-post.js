              The truth is I want to create a platform that replicates the architecture
              and technologies I use daily. Also to get some hands on experience with
              tech like AuthO, GraphQL and CSS Grid.

              I believe React and NodeJs offer a cool solution to build the web. That's
              why a lot of companies and developers go down this route. For me it's an
              opportunity to hand craft my own product - complete freedom.

            What am I building? Agile software delivery ðŸ’»
        </BlogPostHeader>
          <BlogPostBody>
            <p>
              One of these days, I asked my UX colleague if their guild is agile, that is
              if they follow the methodologies and understand their use.
              Immediately a conversation started about what agile is and how
              different teams and people understand or not it's spirit and practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, being agile in software development means to iterate often and deliver
              small, valuable features that get in front of the users in good time. Of course the ceremonies,
              frameworks, tools and processes are there for a reason. But they are just helpers, not the main actor,
              they empower and assist in achieving the goal. Then what is the goal? It varies, 
              for me is to create web applications fast, qualitatively, and learn as much as I can about 
              the parts I'm passionate about. 
            </p>

              To prove my point, I am developing this website in real time. My baby girl is due on
              the 31th of October so I still find a few hours per week to work on my personal projects.
              Even as you read through this post I am ready to implement a new feature, be it of a technical
              nature like <i>Webpack Dev Server</i> or something visible on the screen like a <i>navigation to 
              the home page</i>. I use <StyledLink to="//www.waffle.io" target="_blank">Waffle</StyledLink> & {" "} 
              <StyledLink to="//www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</StyledLink> to manage the project; you can see some items in my backlog 
              on <StyledLink to="//github.com/TudorTacal/genesis/issues" target="_blank">Github</StyledLink>
            </p>
            <p>
              While I was writing the text for this second post, I was also preparing to deploy the code so that
              the changes would be available to all my friends across the world. To achieve this all it takes is 4 commands
              {" "} <i>git add;</i> <i>git commit;</i> <i>git push;</i> and <i>npm run heroku</i>. 
              This ability to ship software that serves a purpose, even a simple one of delivering a 
              message, is in my opinion, the core of agile software development and delivery.

              As for the end goal of this project, there isn't one. For the moment I'm handcrafting my personal website,
              with the idea of creating a platform. Maybe in the future, it will serve as a good foundation for a different
              kind of web application, one that is fast, scalable, secure and ready to receive new features.
              The idea is to have a playground, a breakable toy that I can experiment and enjoy working with while I'm 
              learning and become a better developer.
            </p>

            If you have any feedback about the website 
            or just want to say hello please do get in touch. I like to connect with techies and 
            kindred spirits of any kind.
